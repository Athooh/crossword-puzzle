# Crossword Puzzle Solver Documentation

## Overview

This code solves a crossword puzzle based on a grid and a list of words. The puzzle is represented as a grid with numeric hints indicating where words should be placed. The solution involves parsing the grid, finding positions for words, validating word counts, placing words, and finally solving the puzzle through a backtracking algorithm.

## Code Explanation

### 1. `parsePuzzle(puzzle)`

**Purpose:** 
Parses a puzzle string into a 2D grid format.

**Parameters:**
- `puzzle` (string): The puzzle grid as a string.

**Returns:**
- `grid` (Array<Array<string>> | null): The grid as a 2D array or `null` if the input is invalid.

**Description:**
- Checks if the input is a non-empty string.
- Trims whitespace and splits the string into rows.
- Converts each row into an array of characters and returns the grid.

### 2. `findWordPositions(grid)`

**Purpose:**
Finds potential positions for placing words in the grid.

**Parameters:**
- `grid` (Array<Array<string>>): The grid as a 2D array.

**Returns:**
- `positions` (Array<Object>): An array of objects representing positions and their counts.

**Description:**
- Iterates through each cell in the grid.
- Identifies cells containing numbers between '1' and '2' which indicate potential word positions.
- Stores these positions along with their counts in an array and returns it.

### 3. `validateWordCount(grid, words)`

**Purpose:**
Validates if the number of words matches the expected count from the grid.

**Parameters:**
- `grid` (Array<Array<string>>): The grid as a 2D array.
- `words` (Array<string>): The list of words to be placed.

**Returns:**
- `boolean`: True if the word count matches and all words are unique, otherwise false.

**Description:**
- Calculates the total expected word count based on the grid.
- Validates if the expected word count matches the number of words and if all words are unique.

### 4. `canPlaceWord(grid, word, row, col, direction)`

**Purpose:**
Checks if a word can be placed in the grid at the specified position.

**Parameters:**
- `grid` (Array<Array<string>>): The grid as a 2D array.
- `word` (string): The word to be placed.
- `row` (number): The starting row index.
- `col` (number): The starting column index.
- `direction` (string): The direction of placement ('horizontal' or 'vertical').

**Returns:**
- `boolean`: True if the word can be placed, otherwise false.

**Description:**
- Checks if the word fits within the row or column bounds.
- Verifies if each cell where the word would be placed is either empty, contains a dot, or matches the word's character.

### 5. `placeWord(grid, word, row, col, direction)`

**Purpose:**
Places a word in the grid at the specified position.

**Parameters:**
- `grid` (Array<Array<string>>): The grid as a 2D array.
- `word` (string): The word to be placed.
- `row` (number): The starting row index.
- `col` (number): The starting column index.
- `direction` (string): The direction of placement ('horizontal' or 'vertical').

**Returns:**
- `boolean`: True if the word was placed, otherwise false.

**Description:**
- Checks if the word can be placed using the `canPlaceWord` function.
- If valid, places the word in the grid either horizontally or vertically.

### 6. `removeWord(grid, word, row, col, direction)`

**Purpose:**
Removes a word from the grid at the specified position.

**Parameters:**
- `grid` (Array<Array<string>>): The grid as a 2D array.
- `word` (string): The word to be removed.
- `row` (number): The starting row index.
- `col` (number): The starting column index.
- `direction` (string): The direction of removal ('horizontal' or 'vertical').

**Description:**
- Resets the cells where the word was placed back to '0'.

### 7. `crosswordSolver(puzzle, words)`

**Purpose:**
Solves the crossword puzzle based on the provided grid and words.

**Parameters:**
- `puzzle` (string): The puzzle grid as a string.
- `words` (Array<string>): The list of words to be placed.

**Returns:**
- `string`: The solved grid as a string or an error message.

**Description:**
- Parses the puzzle into a grid and validates the words.
- Sorts words by length in descending order.
- Uses a backtracking algorithm to place words in the grid.
- Returns the solved grid as a string or an error message if no solution is found or multiple solutions exist.

### 8. `gridToString(grid)`

**Purpose:**
Converts the grid back to a string format.

**Parameters:**
- `grid` (Array<Array<string>>): The grid as a 2D array.

**Returns:**
- `string`: The grid as a string.

**Description:**
- Joins each row into a string and then joins all rows with newline characters.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const emptyPuzzle = `2001
0..0
1000
0..0`;
const words = ['casa', 'alan', 'ciao', 'anta'];

crosswordSolver(emptyPuzzle, words);
```

This example uses the `crosswordSolver` function to solve a puzzle defined by `emptyPuzzle` and a list of words.
